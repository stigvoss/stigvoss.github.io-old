First of all, welcome to my blog and curriculum vitae. I am a enthusiastic software developer, primarily .NET, on both a hobby and a professional level.

As a co-founder of danest consulting, I am a self-employed software development consultant focusing on smaller tasks or projects with a goal to convert needs or requirements of non-technical customers to the technical correct solution.

Besides software development, I have a curious hobby interest in subjects such as software and IT security, cryptography, video surveillance, and server and network setups.

I am proud to be called a gigantic nerd. I bear the title with pride as a proof of my dedication to my profession.
